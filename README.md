# MyDataSciencePortfolio
Welcome to my data science project portfolio. Most of my projects will be demoed in jupyter notebook and Google Colaboratory using public datasets from various sources.

My project collection covers various trending machine learning applications such as Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Customer Segmentation, and Churn prediction. There are more to come in the future.
